# Decisions, assumptions, and risks

## Working decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Revisit when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Embedded MissionControl at `.mc/` | Keep plans with the project and preserve `tasks/` for robot tasks | Repository workflow changes |
| MuJoCo-first on the available Mac, stabilized G1 tabletop | Explicit user constraint; local simulation and training before other platforms | Future Isaac/hardware access |
| Native JEPA + LeWM first | Native reference plus one external backend meets MVP scope | TASK-002 finds a compatibility blocker |
| JEPA-WMs optional research follow-up | Keep restrictive upstream components out of required core | Separate license/usage review |
| Image goals and shared CEM/MPC | Direct implementation of the PRD comparison contract | Native-mode follow-up |
| One grasp synergy per hand initially | Limit action complexity while preserving both hands in the API | Grasp coverage proves insufficient |
| Local planning before environment installation | Mac is confirmed; dataset, exact assets, MPS operator support, and future robot access need validation | M0 readiness inventory |

A candidate starting point for `native_jepa` is a compact RGB encoder, robot-state/action conditioning, latent dynamics predictor, an EMA target encoder, and explicit variance/covariance regularization. This is a project proposal, not an assertion about LeWM's loss. TASK-011 must test collapse prevention and recursive rollout behavior. No pixel decoder is required.

## Open decisions with resolving tasks

| Unknown | Current assumption | Resolve in |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Local compute | Observed arm64 macOS 26.5.1, 48 GiB memory; MPS support and free storage still to measure | TASK-001, 003 |
| Actual G1 EDU4 joint/hand/camera configuration | Dual Dex3 as specified, precise calibration pending | TASK-001, 008 |
| Existing demonstrations and rights | No usable dataset assumed yet | TASK-001, 010 |
| Python/framework versions | Choose macOS arm64 compatible pins after MuJoCo and LeWM spike | TASK-002, 003, 005 |
| External checkpoint suitability | Train on G1 canonical data; no transferable checkpoint assumed | TASK-002, 015 |
| Action frequency/scales and IK implementation | Unset until tested in simulation | TASK-004, 008 |
| Owners, staffing, delivery date | Unassigned; effort ranges only | Assign when execution starts |
| Isaac and physical execution | Future ports; local preparation now, commissioning when resources exist | TASK-022, 025, 026 |

## Risk register

| Risk | Early signal | Mitigation / task |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Upstream data/actions mismatch | Adapter needs future state or hardcoded action dimensions | Canonical-batch spike before full integration; 002/004 |
| MuJoCo G1/Dex3 asset is missing or differs from EDU4 | Joint ordering/camera/hand mismatch | Audit or compose MJCF/meshes and verify dual-hand collisions, inertias, and actuators; 003/008 |
| Representation collapse | Low loss but near-zero latent variance or no action effect | Regularization and action ablations; 011/014 |
| Planner exploits model errors | Predicted goal improves while physical outcomes regress | Short horizon, bounded actions, diverse failure data; 010/013 |
| Dexterous grasping exceeds pilot coverage | Reach works but stable lift fails | Scripted controller baseline, expand grasp data; 018 |
| Mac memory, MPS support, or latency limits | Candidate batches fail or MPC misses deadlines | Adapter chunking, measured image resolution/horizon; 012/017 |
| Simulation-to-real mismatch | Calibrations, dynamics, or camera shifts | Replay, mocks, staged commissioning; 021/022 |
| Evaluation leakage | Shared sessions/goals enter training | Versioned split manifests and held-out combinations; 007/019 |
| Unclear asset/checkpoint terms | No explicit license tied to exact artifact | Track independently; keep optional and unresolved until verified; 002/023 |

Negative research outcomes should generate a diagnosis and reproducible report. They should not be hidden by changing splits or relaxing outcome definitions after evaluation.

## Apple goal-alignment investigation (TASK-041)

The H16 sensor model passed matched action prediction, while committed control and arrival-triggered replanning failed to produce manipulation. These results do not identify one unique cause. Before another physical controller variant, test whether an image-only goal estimate provides useful arm-position information on held-out parent sessions and whether that information survives frozen model forecasts.

Compare a TRAIN mean, TRAIN-only image retrieval and one small neural encoder. Retrieval is a legitimate learned nonparametric candidate; a neural head failing to outperform it does not by itself reject goal alignment. Neither candidate may receive goal joint values or frame identifiers at inference. Measured positions are TRAIN supervision and VAL assessment labels only. Preserve the frozen image-goal contract and existing model checkpoints.

This is an offline feasibility screen for seven named arm positions, not a complete manipulation representation: the same arm pose may correspond to a held or dropped apple. Even a passing result requires a separately reviewed visual-plus-pose cost, TRAIN-only calibration and matched physical model ablations before any final acceptance attempt. Keep the original pixel metric as a frozen baseline. The versioned TASK-041 protocol will specify sampling, metrics and stopping rules before fitting.

The planning-time [data audit](experiments/apple_goal_alignment_data_audit.md) confirms 26 TRAIN and three VAL original parents, with all VAL parents using the closure-burst collection variant. It also finds saved examples with nearly identical arm positions but substantially different apple heights. These metadata/state inspections inform the protocol and are disclosed; they are not prospective model-evaluation outcomes or goal inputs.
