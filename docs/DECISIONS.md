# Decisions, assumptions, and risks

## Working decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Revisit when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Embedded MissionControl at `.mc/` | Keep plans with the project and preserve `tasks/` for robot tasks | Repository workflow changes |
| MuJoCo-first on the available Mac, stabilized G1 tabletop | Explicit user constraint; local simulation and training before other platforms | Future Isaac/hardware access |
| Native JEPA + LeWM first | Native reference plus one external backend meets MVP scope | TASK-002 finds a compatibility blocker |
| JEPA-WMs optional research follow-up | Keep restrictive upstream components out of required core | Separate license/usage review |
| Image goals and shared CEM/MPC | Direct implementation of the PRD comparison contract | **Revisited 2026-09-24**: CEM over the world-model cost is no longer the primary control line — see the pivot below |
| One grasp synergy per hand initially | Limit action complexity while preserving both hands in the API | Grasp coverage proves insufficient |
| Local planning before environment installation | Mac is confirmed; dataset, exact assets, MPS operator support, and future robot access need validation | M0 readiness inventory |

A candidate starting point for `native_jepa` is a compact RGB encoder, robot-state/action conditioning, latent dynamics predictor, an EMA target encoder, and explicit variance/covariance regularization. This is a project proposal, not an assertion about LeWM's loss. TASK-011 must test collapse prevention and recursive rollout behavior. No pixel decoder is required.

## Open decisions with resolving tasks

| Unknown | Current assumption | Resolve in |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Local compute | Observed arm64 macOS 26.5.1, 48 GiB memory; MPS support and free storage still to measure | TASK-001, 003 |
| Actual G1 EDU4 joint/hand/camera configuration | Dual Dex3 as specified, precise calibration pending | TASK-001, 008 |
| Existing demonstrations and rights | No usable dataset assumed yet | TASK-001, 010 |
| Python/framework versions | Choose macOS arm64 compatible pins after MuJoCo and LeWM spike | TASK-002, 003, 005 |
| External checkpoint suitability | Train on G1 canonical data; no transferable checkpoint assumed | TASK-002, 015 |
| Action frequency/scales and IK implementation | Unset until tested in simulation | TASK-004, 008 |
| Owners, staffing, delivery date | Unassigned; effort ranges only | Assign when execution starts |
| Isaac and physical execution | Future ports; local preparation now, commissioning when resources exist | TASK-022, 025, 026 |

## Risk register

| Risk | Early signal | Mitigation / task |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Upstream data/actions mismatch | Adapter needs future state or hardcoded action dimensions | Canonical-batch spike before full integration; 002/004 |
| MuJoCo G1/Dex3 asset is missing or differs from EDU4 | Joint ordering/camera/hand mismatch | Audit or compose MJCF/meshes and verify dual-hand collisions, inertias, and actuators; 003/008 |
| Representation collapse | Low loss but near-zero latent variance or no action effect | Regularization and action ablations; 011/014 |
| Planner exploits model errors | Predicted goal improves while physical outcomes regress | Short horizon, bounded actions, diverse failure data; 010/013 |
| Dexterous grasping exceeds pilot coverage | Reach works but stable lift fails | Scripted controller baseline, expand grasp data; 018 |
| Mac memory, MPS support, or latency limits | Candidate batches fail or MPC misses deadlines | Adapter chunking, measured image resolution/horizon; 012/017 |
| Simulation-to-real mismatch | Calibrations, dynamics, or camera shifts | Replay, mocks, staged commissioning; 021/022 |
| Evaluation leakage | Shared sessions/goals enter training | Versioned split manifests and held-out combinations; 007/019 |
| Unclear asset/checkpoint terms | No explicit license tied to exact artifact | Track independently; keep optional and unresolved until verified; 002/023 |

Negative research outcomes should generate a diagnosis and reproducible report. They should not be hidden by changing splits or relaxing outcome definitions after evaluation.

## Apple goal-alignment investigation (TASK-041)

The H16 sensor model passed matched action prediction, while committed control and arrival-triggered replanning failed to produce manipulation. These results do not identify one unique cause. Before another physical controller variant, test whether an image-only goal estimate provides useful arm-position information on held-out parent sessions and whether that information survives frozen model forecasts.

Compare a TRAIN mean, TRAIN-only image retrieval and one small neural encoder. Retrieval is a legitimate learned nonparametric candidate; a neural head failing to outperform it does not by itself reject goal alignment. Neither candidate may receive goal joint values or frame identifiers at inference. Measured positions are TRAIN supervision and VAL assessment labels only. Preserve the frozen image-goal contract and existing model checkpoints.

This is an offline feasibility screen for seven named arm positions, not a complete manipulation representation: the same arm pose may correspond to a held or dropped apple. Even a passing result requires a separately reviewed visual-plus-pose cost, TRAIN-only calibration and matched physical model ablations before any final acceptance attempt. Keep the original pixel metric as a frozen baseline. The versioned TASK-041 protocol will specify sampling, metrics and stopping rules before fitting.

The planning-time [data audit](experiments/apple_goal_alignment_data_audit.md) confirms 26 TRAIN and three VAL original parents, with all VAL parents using the closure-burst collection variant. It also finds saved examples with nearly identical arm positions but substantially different apple heights. These metadata/state inspections inform the protocol and are disclosed; they are not prospective model-evaluation outcomes or goal inputs.

**Overtaken.** TASK-042's combined visual-and-pose cost reached 77.68% against the
preregistered five-point gate (a 4.30-point gain) and stopped before physical control; see
[apple_aligned_control_results_v1.md](experiments/apple_aligned_control_results_v1.md). The
line this investigation belongs to — image-goal costs consumed by a sampling planner — was
subsequently abandoned as the primary control line by the decision below. The record above
is kept as written.

## Decision 2026-09-24 — abandon CEM over this world-model cost as the primary control line (TASK-054)

**Decision.** Sampling-based planning (CEM/MPC) over the learned world model's cost is
**abandoned as the primary control line**. Behaviour cloning with the world model as a
critic or residual becomes the primary line. No further predictor-architecture protocol is
preregistered. This applies the abandonment clause that
[apple_world_model_v4.md](experiments/apple_world_model_v4.md) pre-declared as Outcome B,
before any v4 number was seen; the clause was recorded as TRIGGERED by TASK-052 and
deferred by exactly one protocol, which was v4.

**Evidence.** [apple_world_model_v4_results.md](experiments/apple_world_model_v4_results.md),
manifest `benchmarks/manifests/apple-world-model-v4.json`, merged as `c5ec88c`.

- All four v4 arms **failed** the 14 preregistered gates: E0 control 10/14, E1 action-chunk
  9/14, E2 tail-weighting 9/14, E3 step-embedding 9/14. The untouched control passed more
  gates than every intervention.
- The primary gate **G2a** (rollout readout error ÷ the model's own persistence readout,
  threshold ≤ 0.8) came in at **0.8763 / 0.8814 / 0.8635 / 0.9036**. No arm passed, and
  none came close. G2a has never passed: 0.835 at v2, 0.831 at best in v3.
- The error decomposition (median, moving windows, h = 8, cm; encoded target / rollout /
  excess) shows the encoder improving while the rollout term did not, with the excess
  roughly tripling between v2 and v4: v2 3.26 / 3.65 / 0.39; E0 2.5903 / 3.6481 / 1.0578;
  E1 2.5403 / 3.6579 / 1.1176; E2 2.5723 / 3.4754 / 0.9031; E3 3.6130 / 4.4087 / 0.7957.
- Episode-clustered paired bootstrap (20,000 resamples, seed 20540) against E0 on the
  rollout term: E1 **+0.010 cm [−0.407, +0.367]** (crosses zero), E2 **−0.173 cm
  [−0.804, +0.132]** (crosses zero), E3 **+0.761 cm [+0.155, +1.199]** (excludes zero —
  E3 damaged the encoder). No interval is available for the G9 rollout-excess contrast;
  the bootstrap field is a different estimand.
- **Five attempts to close the rollout gap have now failed**: a second camera (v3, made
  readout precision worse), motion-weighted readout shaping (v3, no help and it hurt
  candidate ranking), action chunking (v4 E1, no effect), tail weighting (v4 E2, a 14.6%
  reduction of the excess where 49.9% was required, and not distinguishable from cohort
  sampling), and a non-shared per-step predictor (v4 E3, damaged the encoder).
- All three v4 interventions also **cost candidate ranking** — G6a 0.5438 for the control
  against 0.2865 / 0.3296 / 0.4141 — and the control is the only v4 arm that passes the one
  metric a CEM directly needs.

**What is explicitly NOT abandoned.**

- **The LeWM backend.** Both backends and the one-line backend swap are unchanged, and the
  next line runs on the same LeWM backend.
- **The encoder.** It is the component that works and is still improving (palm–apple offset
  read to 2.35–2.59 cm, against 3.13 cm at v2), with no representation collapse (effective
  rank 6.74–8.23). It is unfinished, not solved: 2.5903 cm alone exceeds the 1.5 cm G1
  threshold.
- **The product goal.** LeWM controlling G1 + dual Dex3 is unchanged. Only the control
  formulation changed.
- **The CEM/MPC implementation, the frozen benchmark and the result schema.** They stay in
  the repository, under test, as the shared planner and evaluation contracts. Nothing was
  deleted and no historical result was revised.

**What this does not establish.** That the prediction step cannot be fixed. v4 tested three
specific designs at one seed and one budget. What it establishes is that the pre-declared
decision rule's condition was met and the rule is being followed rather than renegotiated
after the fact. Learned Apple→Plate remains at 0 successes.
