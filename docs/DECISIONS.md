# Decisions, assumptions, and risks

## Working decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Revisit when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Embedded MissionControl at `.mc/` | Keep plans with the project and preserve `tasks/` for robot tasks | Repository workflow changes |
| MuJoCo-first on the available Mac, stabilized G1 tabletop | Explicit user constraint; local simulation and training before other platforms | Future Isaac/hardware access |
| Native JEPA + LeWM first | Native reference plus one external backend meets MVP scope | TASK-002 finds a compatibility blocker |
| JEPA-WMs optional research follow-up | Keep restrictive upstream components out of required core | Separate license/usage review |
| Image goals and shared CEM/MPC | Direct implementation of the PRD comparison contract | Native-mode follow-up |
| One grasp synergy per hand initially | Limit action complexity while preserving both hands in the API | Grasp coverage proves insufficient |
| Local planning before environment installation | Mac is confirmed; dataset, exact assets, MPS operator support, and future robot access need validation | M0 readiness inventory |

A candidate starting point for `native_jepa` is a compact RGB encoder, robot-state/action conditioning, latent dynamics predictor, an EMA target encoder, and explicit variance/covariance regularization. This is a project proposal, not an assertion about LeWM's loss. TASK-011 must test collapse prevention and recursive rollout behavior. No pixel decoder is required.

## Open decisions with resolving tasks

| Unknown | Current assumption | Resolve in |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Local compute | Observed arm64 macOS 26.5.1, 48 GiB memory; MPS support and free storage still to measure | TASK-001, 003 |
| Actual G1 EDU4 joint/hand/camera configuration | Dual Dex3 as specified, precise calibration pending | TASK-001, 008 |
| Existing demonstrations and rights | No usable dataset assumed yet | TASK-001, 010 |
| Python/framework versions | Choose macOS arm64 compatible pins after MuJoCo and LeWM spike | TASK-002, 003, 005 |
| External checkpoint suitability | Train on G1 canonical data; no transferable checkpoint assumed | TASK-002, 015 |
| Action frequency/scales and IK implementation | Unset until tested in simulation | TASK-004, 008 |
| Owners, staffing, delivery date | Unassigned; effort ranges only | Assign when execution starts |
| Isaac and physical execution | Future ports; local preparation now, commissioning when resources exist | TASK-022, 025, 026 |

## Risk register

| Risk | Early signal | Mitigation / task |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Upstream data/actions mismatch | Adapter needs future state or hardcoded action dimensions | Canonical-batch spike before full integration; 002/004 |
| MuJoCo G1/Dex3 asset is missing or differs from EDU4 | Joint ordering/camera/hand mismatch | Audit or compose MJCF/meshes and verify dual-hand collisions, inertias, and actuators; 003/008 |
| Representation collapse | Low loss but near-zero latent variance or no action effect | Regularization and action ablations; 011/014 |
| Planner exploits model errors | Predicted goal improves while physical outcomes regress | Short horizon, bounded actions, diverse failure data; 010/013 |
| Dexterous grasping exceeds pilot coverage | Reach works but stable lift fails | Scripted controller baseline, expand grasp data; 018 |
| Mac memory, MPS support, or latency limits | Candidate batches fail or MPC misses deadlines | Adapter chunking, measured image resolution/horizon; 012/017 |
| Simulation-to-real mismatch | Calibrations, dynamics, or camera shifts | Replay, mocks, staged commissioning; 021/022 |
| Evaluation leakage | Shared sessions/goals enter training | Versioned split manifests and held-out combinations; 007/019 |
| Unclear asset/checkpoint terms | No explicit license tied to exact artifact | Track independently; keep optional and unresolved until verified; 002/023 |

Negative research outcomes should generate a diagnosis and reproducible report. They should not be hidden by changing splits or relaxing outcome definitions after evaluation.
